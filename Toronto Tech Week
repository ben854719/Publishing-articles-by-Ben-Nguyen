Meeting the team at Faire was like stepping into the future. CTO Marcelo Cortes opened about the foundation of Faire. The Development team mentions the use of large language models into their platform, making e-commerce smarter and more intuitive. Hearing Thuan Pham, formerly Uber’s CTO, share his lessons on scaling infrastructure felt like a mentorship session with someone who’s seen the tech trenches firsthand.

🏛️ Mars Morning: Frontiers of AI and Policy.

At the Mars Discovery District, I had the incredible opportunity to meet Evan Solomon, Canada’s first Minister of AI. His announcement of the AI Compute Access Fund—a government initiative providing subsidized compute resources to small and medium-sized businesses was a game-changer.

Finally, a bridge between innovation and access. This isn’t just policy; it’s a bold move to democratize AI development.

If startup dreams had a playbook, the founder of Super.com practically handed it to us. From funding strategies to tactical growth, every insight was rooted in lived experience. It wasn’t about shortcuts—it was about vision, resilience, and smart execution.

💡 ADA and 1Password: Founders Who Inspire.

The founders behind ADA and 1Password brought humanity to tech. Their stories of perseverance, culture-building, and staying true to their values offered a refreshing reminder: successful tech isn’t just built on code—it’s built on character.
